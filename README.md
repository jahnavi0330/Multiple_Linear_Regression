# Multiple Linear Regression

Multiple linear regression (MLR) is a statistical technique that helps determine the relationship between a single dependent variable and multiple independent variables.

    ->The model plots a straight line after being trained on a training set and its performance is evaluated for a testing set. 
    ->It is different from Simple Linear Regression in terms of the number of input features. 
    ->It consists of multiple input features whereas the Simple Linear Regression takes only a single input feature.

Required python libraries: 1) numpy 2) matplotlib 3) pandas 4) sklearn

The python implementation uses the sklearn library to build a regression model which is trained with the training set.

###used data : car_purchasing_data

we import the required libraries.And the data should be pre-processed before training the model.
    ->Every column should should contain only numerical data.
    ->should not contain null values.
    ->Unnecessary columns should be removed.
